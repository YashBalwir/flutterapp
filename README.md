# flutterapp
 flutter app with my sql and node js server 



here are the files which i have used

Adduserpage.dart : it adds user to the database

Connectivity.dart : it connects the server and app 

mainpage.dart ; homme page for the app

main.js : js file which creates the server for data transaction between app and azure mysql database

Here you have to add some module for the creation of server 
such as 
nodemon and mysql2 express
you have to create a directory  named "server" in which you have install these two modules and have to save your main.js file in server folder

hope this is helpful thank you
